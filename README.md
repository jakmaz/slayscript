# 💅 SlayScript 💻

Welcome to **SlayScript** – the programming language that _rocks harder_ than any other! This isn’t just another language; it’s a lifestyle. Let’s dive in and see how SlayScript brings the **drip** to your code, one `combo` at a time.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Here’s how to make your code _slay_ with SlayScript.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jakmaz/slayscript
cd slayscript

# Build it
cargo build // No stable build yet
```

### 🧑‍💻 JavaScript vs SlayScript

Let's see how this compares to JavaScript. In JavaScript, you'd have to do something like this:

```javascript
let a = 10 / 2;
```

This is... *boring*, right? A simple division statement with no personality, no flair. But check out how **SlayScript** takes it to the next level:

```slay
fresh a be 10 ratio 2;
```

And that's a real production code!

## 🔥 Syntax Explanations

### Variable Definition

In **SlayScript**, the keyword `fresh` is used to define a new variable. It’s like saying "yo, here’s something fresh!" rather than the boring `let` or `var`.

```slay
fresh x be 10;
```

This would define a new variable `x` and set it to `10`.

- **`fresh`**: The keyword for defining new variables.
- **`be`**: Used instead of `=` to assign values.
- The operator (like `ratio`, `combo`, etc.) will come later when you need to perform operations.

### Mathematical Operators

In **SlayScript**, we spice up basic math operations. Here’s how it works:

| SlayScript Operator | What It Means | JavaScript Equivalent |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| `drip`              | Adds some flair  | `+`                   |
| `lack`              | Take away the vibes  | `-`                   |
| `combo`             | A power move   | `*`                   |
| `ratio`             | Divide and conquer  | `/`                   |

### Example Usage

```slay
fresh result be 5 drip 3;  // Equivalent to 5 + 3
```

This is **SlayScript** doing what it does best—adding **flair** to basic arithmetic. You can now say you're adding with some serious style.

## 🤔 Why?

Why not? If you’re going to code, you might as well make it **legendary**. **SlayScript** lets you ditch the boring syntax and gives your code some real personality.

## 🐛 Bugs?
