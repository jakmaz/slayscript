# 💅 SlayScript 💻

Welcome to **SlayScript** – the programming language that _rocks harder_ than any other! This isn’t just another language; it’s a lifestyle. Let’s dive in and see how SlayScript brings the **drip** to your code, one `combo` at a time.

## 🤘 What is SlayScript?

SlayScript is a unique programming language designed to keep your coding sessions **hype**. Forget the boring `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators and embrace **drip**, **lack**, **combo**, and **ratio**. It’s like programming in the middle of a mosh pit.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Here’s how to make your code _slay_ with SlayScript.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jakmaz/slayscript
cd slayscript

# Build it
cargo build
```

### Syntax

Here’s a taste of how you can throw down with SlayScript:

```rust
use slayscript::{Expr, Op, Number};

// Slayin' some math
let result = Expr::new("1drip2"); // equivalent to 1 + 2

// Rock on 🤘
assert_eq!(
    result,
    Expr {
        lhs: Number(1),
        rhs: Number(2),
        op: Op::Add,
    }
);
```

### Operators in SlayScript

| Operator | What It Means in SlayScript | What It Really Means |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `drip`   | You’re adding some flair    | `+`                  |
| `lack`   | Take away the vibes         | `-`                  |
| `combo`  | A power move                | `*`                  |
| `ratio`  | Divide and conquer          | `/`                  |

## 🤔 Why?

Why not? If you’re going to code, you might as well make it **legendary**.
